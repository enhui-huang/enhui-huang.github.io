### <ins>Active Learning-based Interactive Database Exploration</ins>
There is an increasing gap between the fast growth of data and the limited human ability to comprehend data. Consequently, there has been a growing demand of data management tools that can bridge this gap and help the user retrieve high-value content from data more effectively. In this work, we aim to build interactive data exploration as a new database service, using an approach called “explore-by-example”. In particular, we cast the explore-by-example problem in a principled “active learning” framework, and bring the properties of important classes of database queries to bear on the design of new algorithms and optimizations for active learningbased database exploration. These new techniques allow the database system to overcome fundamental limitations of traditional active learning, in particular, the slow convergence problem.
